<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am a data science master student at Brown University. I am expected to graduate in 2024, and am looking forward to apply for Ph.D. programs related to computer science, data science and artificial intelligence. If you are looking for a Ph.D. student, I would sincerely appreciate it if you could consider me as a candidate!

My research interest includes computational linguistics, computer vision and vision-language models. I had research experience with building language models with image embeddings as additional supervision signals. I also implemented Transformer-like, GPT-like, and BERT-like models in my project, TransformerHub. In computer vision, I have implemented several well-known architectures like SIFT, ConvNet, ViT, and NoisyStudent. I also have plenty experience with benchmarking models on ImageNet1K, MSCOCO, and ADE4K.

Previously, in 2022, I received my bachelor's degree with honors in Chemistry at <a href='http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/wbout/list.htm'>Cho Kochen Honors College</a>, Zhejiang University. I also got a mini-minor in Computer Science during 2021 - 2022.
